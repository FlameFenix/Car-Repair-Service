# Car-Repair-Service Demo

- <a href="https://car-repair-service.netlify.app/">Car-Repair-Service Demo</a>
- This is a react app for car service workshop. Here you can find information about the services we provide, who we are and what we can help you. The most interesting functionality of the application is that you can book a service that you want to receive for a given date. 

## Functionality: 
- There are three users added in the server
  - acc: flamefenix@abv.bg
  - acc: peter@abv.bg
  - acc: john@abv.bg
  - pass: 123456

 ## Logged-in users:
  - They have access to the whole app, logged-in user can book for a service after filling the form, edit or delete their own booked services.

 ## Guest users: 
  - They can browse app like home, about, send messages from contacts and etc, but cant book for a service and cant see list of booked services.
 
 ## Catalogue:
  - Holds records with all booked services, with names of the owners, type of service, and details about that.
  - Every owner of the record, can see deitals, edit or delete the booked service.
  - User which is not owner of the booked service, can't see the buttons 'edit' and 'delete'.

 ## Administration menu: 
  - Accessible only by flamefenix@abv.bg (kind of admin account)
  - Can read/delete messages (sent from Contacts form)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
